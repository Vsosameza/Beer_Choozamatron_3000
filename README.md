This project explores a dataset of over 1 million user reviews by the publication Beer Advocate. We explore the data set in notebooks 1 and 2.  In the Beer-Choozamatron Noteboook we apply a recommendation algorithm to the dataset attempting to make beer recommendations to a Beer Advocate reviewer based on their previous reviews.
